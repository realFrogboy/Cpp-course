# Matrix
Project for the 4nd task of the C++ course.

## Algorithm
I have implemented the full-pivoting algorithm.

## Test

        ./end_to_end

This program generate 100 matrixes 100x100 with determinant is equal to 42, than add 400 times random rows, subtract 400 times random rows and swap 200 times random cons of this matrixes. Than it rans my program with resulting matrixes and compare answer with 42.
