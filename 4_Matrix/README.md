# Matrix
Project for the 4nd task of the C++ course.

## Algorithm
I have implemented the full-pivoting algorithm.

## Test

        ./end_to_end

This program generate 10 matrixes with determinant is equal to 42, than swap 50 times random rows and 50 times random cons of this matrixes. Than it rans my program with resulting matrixes and compare answer with 42.
