# Tree
Project for the 3rd task of the C++ course.

## Algorithm
I took the implementation of the RB-tree proposed in the book "Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition" T. H. Cormen as basis and added some modifications.

## Instalation
Run:

        git clone "git@github.com:realFrogboy/Cpp-course.git"

## Build

        cd Cpp_course/3_Tree
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ../
        cmake --build ./
